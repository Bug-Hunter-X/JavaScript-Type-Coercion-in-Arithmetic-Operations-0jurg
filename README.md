# JavaScript Type Coercion Bug
This repository demonstrates a common JavaScript bug related to type coercion during arithmetic operations.  JavaScript's dynamic typing allows for implicit type conversion, which can lead to unexpected behavior if not handled carefully.

The `bug.js` file contains code that showcases this issue. The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version with explicit type checking.
